        	<p> Iconic is a front-end JavaScript library that enables icon's advanced features. Included with every Iconic license, <em><a href="https://useiconic.com/sign-in/" title="Sign in " target="new">iconic.js.</a></em></p>
        	<p> You can find here instructions in how to use Iconic <a href="https://useiconic.com/guides/"> from styling to Bootstrap, and everything in between.</a></p>I tested it in my local 
            host. This library has many features, one that called me the attention is to add efects like <em>radial-gradient</em> and <em>linear-gradient</em>, <em>pattern</em>, <em>fill</em>, and <em>stroke.</em>
        
         <p> I was interested in this SVGinjector for inject in HTMl5 and Bootstrap website's framework. This Icons library is very usefull for make all icons responsive in different screen sizes.  </p>

        <p>This is a plugin for Wordpress. I use Worpdress in a 90% of my work, my goal is to have a <em>pixel perfect look</em>. I have many clients that are not so happy with how images "png" looks on their website, <br />especially when they have a big screen.  I have to take care of the quality of the image in any <em>"media query size"</em> and to be responsive in any size. </p>

        <p>I came across to this <em>"old post"</em>, through the recent blog post in Linkedin of my teacher at BCIT <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/controlling-responsive-images-wordpress-breaking-down-morten?trk=prof-post" title="Morten Rand-Hendriksen" target="new">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a> about controlling responsive images in WordPress. <br /> I have been working with WP for more than 4 years and saw all the advanced features about display images on the web, so for me one of the best and advanced solutions for the web was the <a href="http://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/" target="new">Srcset and sizes.</a></p>

   <p> class="results">A decent user experience will be to have a Jquery UI tabs, one for current weather and location and one tab for the next 5 days. <a href="https://jqueryui.com/tabs/">See example tabs here</a><br /> The best option it will be to use Geolocation for display the weather for the place where you live.</p>
